\begin{method}[Preheat the oven to \temp{425}]
     Place the onion, zucchini, bell peppers, carrots, and garlic on a large roasting pan. Drizzle with 1Â½ tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle the thyme on top and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
     
Roast in the oven until vegetables are softened and caramelized, 30-35 minutes. If using two baking sheets, rotate the pans halfway through.
    
    While vegetables are roasting, make the quinoa. Place the quinoa and vegetable (or chicken) stock in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot and reduce heat to low. Simmer until cooked, 12-15 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Remove from heat and transfer quinoa to a large bowl. Add the roasted vegetables to the bowl.
    
    Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil with the balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard in a small bowl. Pour the dressing over the quinoa and vegetables and toss to combine. Serve warm or cold.
